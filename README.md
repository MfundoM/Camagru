# Camagru

The goal of this project was to build a web application a little more complex than the previous ones with a little less means.

## Objectives

In this project, we discovered the notions of:
* Responsive design
* DOM Manipulation
* SQL Debugging
* Cross Site Request Forgery
* Cross Origin Resource Sharing
* and more

This web project challenged me to create a small web application allowing users to make basic photo and video editing using
their webcam and some predefined images.

The appâ€™s users should be able to select an image in a list of superposable images (for instance a picture frame), take a picture
with his/her webcam and admire the result of mixing both pictures.
All captured images are public, likeables and commentable.
